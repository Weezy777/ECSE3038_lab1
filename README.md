 The parallel() function behaves such that when it is called, it outputs the effective resistance of a network of 2 or more resistore connected in pararllel. The function can accept a list of numbers of any length.

 The potential_divider() function behaves such that it takes two values as argument. The first argument represents a voltage supply value and the other represents a list of numbers that represent resistance values of resistors connected in series.The function outputs the voltage drop across each resistor in the resistor list. The function also is able to accept a list of numbers of any length.

The temperature_check() function accepts a single number, a patient's body temperature, and a single character, the unit of temperature. The function outputs whether the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has normal body temperature based on the number passed to the function. The second value passed as argument  tells the function whether the condition should be calculated in degrees celcius or degrees fahrenheit. An appropriate message is written on the screen which tells what the person's condition is. Additionally, a message is sent to the screen to alert the user if they are inputting the wrong units, meaning neither celsius or farenheit. 

These three functions were written for the first Lab Assessment for the course: 
ECSE3038 Engineering Internet of Things.
